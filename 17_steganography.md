# 17-Steganography

### Steganography

* Practicing of concealing a message inside another medium so that only the sender and recipient know of its existence
* **Steganalysis**: the process of discovering the existence of the hidden information in a medium, the reverse process of steganography

#### Methods

* Least significant bit insertion: changes least meaningful bit
* Makes and filters \(grayscale images\): like watermarking
* Algorithmic transformation: hides in mathematical functions used in image compression
* **Noisy areas**: noisy areas are those that draw less attention, like areas with a great deal of natural color variation in the image
* **Transform domain technique**: Steganography hides the information in significant parts of the cover image such as cropping, compression, and some other image processing areas

#### Ways to Identify

* Text: character positions are key; blank spaces, text patterns
* Image: file larger in size; some may have color palette faults
* Audio & Video: require statistical analysis

#### Tools

* QuickStego
* gifshuffle
* MP3Stego
* SNOW
* OpenStego
